There's something magical about seeing this IRL.
The game is just a 2D game projected onto a 3D surface to give the illusion of a hologram. Best results are seen head-on obviously, but it really is a blast seeing a game like this augmented in front of you without an AR or VR device. 

![Laser Cut Build of Pyramid](/ProjectionMapping/cube-build.gif?raw=true "Laser Cutting a Pyramid")

This was originally made with cubes made from laser cut wood (if you have access to a laser cutter, there's a file included [here](/ProjectionMapping/pyramid-laser-cut-file24x18.ai), but you can construct cubes from anything - cardboard, construction paper, etc.

I also included [Blender and Rhino files](/ProjectionMapping) if you want to try 3D printing cubes.

Once you have your pyramid built and the game running, power up a projector and use something like [MadMapper](https://madmapper.com/) to map each surface in the game to the surfaces on the pyramid cubes. Curious if something like [Lightform](https://lightform.com/) could automate this!

What other kind of games and digital experiences can we bring into the world?
